## Notes

So fcking tired today. I woke up at 5pm .-.
### Thoughts on SOC so far
Quite sian. I hate waking up early at 630 just to go SOC at 830 for hoto. I have a full week of that next week. Also another thing that is bothering me is the secondary taskings. I need to plan unit retreat, and that's quite a daunting task. I need to message the CX tmrw to ask more about venues and catering options and schedules. I need to exercise more, but I have been finding it hard to do it. I have no energy to exercise nor the mood to.
