#### S3 brief
Good morning sir,

My name is ME4A Jian Rong from RSN SOC. I'll be going over the AOP for the Upcoming Unit. I want to preface this by saying that I think the idea I had going into planning this was that the retreat was a more informal event, with games and activities. But I learnt that last year's event was more focused on presentations and discussions. So I made these slides with the assumption that this retreat would be more like last year's, so this AOP would be a bit more basic, and we were hoping that you could shed more light on the direction that CO wants this retreat to go, and we can discuss from there.


So this AOP would be discussing 3 things: the proposed retreat schedule, the potential venues, and catering options.

The theme for this year's retreat would be SOC + CIRT integration. This is probably the first time soc and cirt are meeting after CDG 2.0, except for unity, so it would be a good chance for each side to get to know each other. So other than the usual like high level wrap up, when it comes to individual coy sharing, I want each coy to firstly explain like the basics of their own SOP as an introduction, what each coy learnt from EX Unity, how they would want to improve things for next year's unity, and then finally 1 or 2 tips which they think that soc cirt integration should go.

Then finally, we would have the soc and cirts sit down and discuss a potential SOC/CIRT SOP




Questions
 - I was looking at last year's retreat, and I'm wondering why we need 2 days for the retreat? I guess im want you to shed some light on the direction of the retret. I know last year we had 2 ish sessions 1 for OC and above, and 1 for PC and above. Are 2 days required for everything we need to discuss?
