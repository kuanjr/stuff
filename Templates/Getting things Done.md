 - The aim of *Getting Things Done* is not simply to get more done.
	 - The point is to become appropriately engaged with your work and life and to eliminate distractions, stress and anxiety. You want a **mind like water**, able to respond and focus when you need to
	 - **Open loops** distract us and make it hard to focus. The GTD system gets these loops out of your mind and into a reliable, trusted system.
 - GTD involves these 5 steps:
	 1. **Capture**. Put everything into physical or digital in-trays so you have no open loops
	 2. **Clarify**. Separate out the actionable from the non-actionable items. For all actionable items, decode on what the *next* iteration will be. If the next action takes less than 2 minutes, just do it immediately (the 2 minute rule).
	 3. **Organise**. Put your remaining 'next actions' on your calendar or on separate lists so they are available when and where you need them. If a task involves more than one action, treat it as a *project* and record it on a Projects list.
	 4. **Reflect**. Do a *weekly review* of your open loops and make sure your system is complete and up-to-date.
	 5. **Engage**. As long as you've done the previous steps, you can trust your intuition to decide what to focus on at any point.
 - GTD is a lifelong practice and you'll get better at it over time.
	 - you can expect to get blown off course a few times, but it's easy to get back on track
	 - It can easily take 2 years to get to a stage where GTD feels fully integrated with your life
	 - But you don't have to implement GTD in full to benefit from it. Finding a few "good tricks" may be enough to make reading the book (or this summary) worthwhile
