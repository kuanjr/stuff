Good day,

I am seeking a quotation for catering from your company for a MINDEF event. 
1. I require catering for tea break and lunch (buffet). 
2. The budget is $8 and $15, respectively.
3. The event will be held on 9 Jan 2025, with 31 pax present. 

I look forward to your swift reply.

Regards,
Jian Rong
