### Message to CX
Hi CX,

This ME4A Jian Rong from RSN SOC. I'm being tasked to plan the upcoming unit retreat. Since I am new to this unit, I'm have a few questions regarding this.

1. I am not sure what is expected during the Unit Retreat. May I know what was done during the previous unit retreats, and if possible, can I have the contact number of whoever planned last years retreat for me to contact?
   
2. For venues, I heard that CO suggested CNB collab space, but that one is booked all the way until 30 Jan. Are there any other alternatives we can consider? Other alternatives I have in mind are:
	- Chevron
	- SAF Chalet Function Rooms
	- SAFRA function rooms

3. For catering options, may I know what companies we usually engage for these kind of events?

I'm briefing S3 on Friday, so I intend to give him 3 venue options and 3 catering options. Thank you for your help!
